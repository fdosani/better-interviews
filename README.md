An Open source framework for conducting technical interview question


As someone who does hiring, I find the interview process is broken. So I'm
hoping to do my part to help fix this. In this repo/site you will find a Open
source framework for technical interviews which I hope anyone and everyone can
use to conduct the dreaded technical interview ( white boarding / live coding).

> Note: this is not going to be a perfect solution, but it is a start which
I'm hoping will evolve overtime to be better, more inclusive, and less stressful.


## Problem:
The current state of technical (white boarding) interviews is broken.
See: [THEY WHITEBOARDED ME](http://they.whiteboarded.me/interview_types/whiteboarding_and_live_coding.html)
and this [The Mental Impact of Tech Interviews (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIrKC41NwC0)

## Potential Solution:
We need to find a better way to handle for the above problem:
* Avoiding the power imbalance between interviewer and interviewee.
* Removing bias from the interview process which can many times penalize:
  - interviewers with families (age, or gender discrimination)
  - mental health issues (anxiety etc.)
* this is a very short list, but you get the idea.

#### Choose your path

As a initial option the thought is you allow the candidate to pick from several
options which they are comfortable with in terms of conducting their technical
interview.

1. Take home exam
   - Company specific curated take home assignment which the candidate would do
     on their own time and turn in for grading


2. Complete a assignment (from a list of smallish problems):
   - Candidate would get this "homework" before their interview to complete.
   - They would submit their solution 1-2 hours before for review by the    
     interviewee. This allows for time to review and formulate some questions
     and suggestions in response.
   - Interviewee would then asking probing questions about the


3. Their own personal project
   - TBD


4. Living coding / white boarding
   - TBD


## Contributing:
I need your (the community at large) help with this project. Please feel free to
submit issues, comments, PRs etc. The only way this works is through a
collaborative effort.



## TODO:

- Build out site
- Framework for interaction model
- Gather /source standardize take home/small assignments.
