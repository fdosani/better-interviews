# Interviewing Options

Understanding the various interviewing options to get a sense of how they are
typically used, what is involved, pros, cons, and biases.

### Whiteboarding

Whiteboarding can be the use a of a physical whiteboard or a online code/sharing
editor where a candidate is given a problem and expected to come up with a
solution within a specific timeframe, and normally think aloud their problem.

Typically the problems candidates are given are algorithmic or puzzle type
questions typically of what you mind find on [leetcode](https://leetcode.com) or [hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)

#### Pros

- identifying candidates whom are exceptionally brilliant, quick thinkers, and
  extremely knowledgable about the specific technical topic at hand
- See how well candidates can perform under pressure and scrutiny in real time.
- If done online can help companies and candidates optimize on costs and time
  of being on-site and in-person
- Generally can be a low effort (cheap) way to screen out candidates whom might
  not be technical enough for the role at hand. This can be effect in a company
  where there are many many applicants.

#### Cons

- Can lead to a lot of false negatives
- Can bias against people whom have family commitments (caregivers,
  single parents, etc.)
- Unintentionally discriminate based on age (favouring those whom might have
  time to study, or have recently graduated from academia)
- Creates a pressure cooker situation where candidates make mistakes[1]
  - People whom might suffer from anxiety might perform well in these situations
- Many of the questions asked in these formats are not real world type problems
  and ultimately someone whom can invert a binary tree may not be able to
  deliver on actual business problems faced by businesses
- If candidate has potentially memorized the solution (from another interview
  or seen it posted online) this again may not be indicative of their true
  knowledge.
- Unfair power imbalance between candidates and interviewers
