# Contributing

Much of what is in this framework are discussions thoughts from all over the internet. To make this framework viable we need everyone to contribute.

- Creating realistic problem sets for candidates to work at (for various job types)
- Rubicon for grading (what should interviewers be looking for)
- Guidance on the things to do and not to do

Please consider helping out! Issues, Comments, and PRs are all welcomed!
