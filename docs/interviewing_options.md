# Interviewing Options

Overview the most common interviewing options to get a sense of how they are
typically used, what is: involved, pros, cons, and biases.



## Whiteboarding

Whiteboarding can be the use a of a physical whiteboard or a online code/sharing
editor where a candidate is given a problem and expected to come up with a
solution within a specific timeframe, and normally think aloud their problem.

Typically the problems candidates are given are algorithmic or puzzle type
questions typically of what you mind find on [leetcode](https://leetcode.com)
or [hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)

#### Pros

- identifying candidates whom are exceptionally brilliant, quick thinkers, and
  extremely knowledgable about the specific technical topic at hand
- See how well candidates can perform under pressure and scrutiny in real time.
- If done online can help companies and candidates optimize on costs and time
  of being on-site and in-person
- Generally can be a low effort (cheap) way to screen out candidates whom might
  not be technical enough for the role at hand. This can be effect in a company
  where there are many many applicants.

#### Cons

- Can lead to a lot of false negatives
- Unintentionally discriminate based on age (favouring those whom might have
  time to study, or have recently graduated from academia)
- Creates a pressure cooker situation where candidates make mistakes[1]
  - People whom might suffer from anxiety might perform well in these situations
- Many of the questions asked in these formats are not real world type problems
  and ultimately someone whom can invert a binary tree may not be able to
  deliver on actual business problems faced by businesses


## Take-home tests (Homework, Challenges)

Take-home tests are where a candidate is given an assignment to do on their own
time and typically expected to return their completed assignment back in a set
period time. this can be hours or days. Sometimes the results of the assignment
become the topic of conversation during the on-site portion of the interview.

#### Pros

- Allows the candidate to work on their own time, space, environment setup, etc.
- Candidate can use Google, and other online (legit) resources like they might
  at a typical job
- Can be done during non work hours allowing candidates more freedom
- Less anxiety involved for candidate as no one is watching them
- Certain types of tests might be conducive to automated testing to check
  results and validity
- Again this can be a cheap way to screen candidates as they don't need to come
  on-site, and act as a stopper for those who are not super serious about
  actually interviewing
- Removes the power imbalance that can occur in whiteboard style interview.

#### Cons

- Possibility of candidates plagiarizing work
- This could indirectly discriminate against some candidates who do not
  have the time outside of work (family, children, caregiver, religious
  commitments etc.)
- Again can unintentionally discriminate based on age (favouring those whom
  might have more free time and can iterate on better solutions)
- Depending on the complexity of the assignment it may require time for someone
  to grade and properly evaluate. Depending on the volume of candidates this
  can be a huge problem.


## Bring your own personal code or project

Bringing your own personal code or projects is another method similar to a take
type of test. The main difference here is that this is something the candidate
has built vs being told to do. This could be a open source project which they
have contributed to or maybe a smaller hobby type project. During the interview
process

#### Pros

- Allows the candidate to work on their own time, space, environment setup, etc.
- Can be done during non work hours allowing candidates more freedom
- Less anxiety for the candidate
- Removes the power imbalance that can occur in whiteboard style interview.
- Shows the candidates passions outside their core work or job.
- Can lessen burden on candidate as it utilizes existing work, and the only
  effort might might involve reviewing the code if it has been a while.

#### Cons

- Possibility of candidates plagiarizing work
- Not everyone has hobby projects which they can show off
- Again this could indirectly discriminate against some candidates who do not
  have the time outside of work (family, children, caregiver, religious
  commitments etc.)
- project may not be relevant to the job at hand therefore making it hard to
  evaluate the candidates skill set



## Automated coding challenge

Typical websites which can ask a variety of coding question with "correct"
answers. Can be many question or sometimes a single longer one. These sites will
have a online editor (for the language of choice) and a timer. Sometimes the
questions can be multiple choice, coding questions with a set of test cases
which must pass, or combination of both.

#### Pros

- Allows the candidate to work on their own time, space, environment setup, etc.
- Can be done during non work hours allowing candidates more freedom
- Cheap and quick screening method.
- Fully automated.
- Able to equally judges candidates ability to code in a certain time frame

#### Cons

- Possibility of candidates plagiarizing work may still exist.
- Again this could indirectly discriminate against some candidates who do not
  have the time outside of work (family, children, caregiver, religious
  commitments etc.)
- Depending the questions being asked there is no feedback loop in realtime
  where the candidate can get help if they are unclear about something.
- Being timed could be stressful for some people.
